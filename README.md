# Wing Modal Analysis 
In this project, you'll find the full project details of a modal analysis of a typical aircraft wing. Below you'll notice that one end is fixed (as it would be to the fuselage). The same image also shows the mesh

The modes of the aluminum wing are:
| Mode     | Frequency [Hz] |
| ---      | ---       |
| 1 | 4.83 |
| 2 | 25.32 |
| 3 | 32.17 |
| 4 | 38.08 |
| 5 | 48.30 |
| 6 | 53.53 |

The final results below indicate the total deformation at each mode. 
### Mode 1
